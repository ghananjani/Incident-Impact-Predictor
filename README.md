# Incident Impact Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the impact of service incidents using data analysis and predictive modeling. The goal is to provide insights into potential impacts, allowing for proactive management of service incidents.

## Key Features
- **Data Analysis:** Utilized Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn for comprehensive data analysis.
- **Data Cleaning:** Addressed missing values, removed unnecessary strings, and handled outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explored and visualized data patterns, correlations, and distributions.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Implemented predictive models to forecast the impact of service incidents.
- **Feature Engineering:** Engineered features for improved model performance.
- **Visualization:** Created informative visualizations to interpret data trends and model results.
- **Profile Report:** Utilized pandas_profiling to generate a detailed report on dataset characteristics.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from "sample_service.xlsx" and includes various attributes related to service incidents.
